Hi, my name is **Epicgo**, I'm 20 years old and I develop with **Java** and **Kotlin** language, I've been working with **Spigot** and **Bukkit** API for 8 years, I write clean and optimized code and most of the resources created in my git are free for everyone.

* 👋 Hi, I’m Epicgo.
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Minecraft (Spigot) related stuff.
* 💬 Talk to me about minecraft related topics.
* 👀 Preferred language: Spanish or English.

###### You're not going to find an extended profile page which took hours to write, this "readme" merely exists as a place to drop my contact information, but feel free to drop me a line if you want to talk about something.

###### Please direct questions or issues regarding Minecraft plugins in the appropriate sections on Github.

###### If you're looking to collaborate or take over a project, send an email to the address mentioned above.
